### Async & Await
Async keyword is used to make a function asynchronous.When we place `async` keyword in front of a function, it becomes asynchronous and executes asynchronously via even loop.Asynchronous functions always returns a promise.If the value returned is not a promise then javascript puts a wrapper and makes it a promise.
